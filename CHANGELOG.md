## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Settings page: an interactive "try it" runner on each enabled tool card - reveal
  a form generated from the tool's parameter schema, confirm, and run one MCP tool
  in isolation with its result rendered inline, without a chat turn. Backed by a new
  `POST /api/agent/tools/{name}/run` endpoint that runs a single scufris tool
  in-process (bypassing the agent) and refuses a disabled tool (403), an unknown tool
  (404), or bad args (422). The tools listing (`GET /api/agent/tools`) now also
  exposes each tool's typed parameter schema.
