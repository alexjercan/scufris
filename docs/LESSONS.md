# Lessons

The compressed memory of mistakes this repo has already paid for. One or two
lines per lesson; `/compound` appends here after a task's retro. Grep this for
your area before starting work. At 3+ recurrences a lesson is a candidate to
promote into AGENTS.md, a skill, or the tooling itself.

## Build / environment

- `dep-change-needs-nix-develop-rebuild` (x1): the active dev shell runs a fixed
  nix-store uv2nix venv, so a new dependency added with `uv add` is invisible to
  a bare `pytest`/`mypy`. Run checks via `nix develop --command ...` (or re-enter
  the shell) so the venv rebuilds from the updated `uv.lock`. 20260719-154420.
- `new-scufris-module-needs-package-init` (x1): mypy errors with "Source file
  found twice under different module names" when a `scufris/` module has no
  package `__init__.py`. `scufris/__init__.py` now exists; keep it.
